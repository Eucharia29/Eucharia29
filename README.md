# Reositories containing projects done for my internship Program at Oasis Infobyte

## **Project 1** : [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Eucharia29/OIBSIP/tree/main/Project%201)

### **Project Description:**

The aim of this data analytics project is to perform customer segmentation analysis for an e-
commerce company. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, the goal is to
group customers into distinct segments. This segmentation can inform targeted marketing
strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies.

## Key Concepts and Challenges:

- **Data Collection:** Obtain a dataset containing customer information, purchase history, and
relevant data.

- **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Explore the dataset, understand its structure, and handle
any missing or inconsistent data.

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate key metrics such as average purchase value, frequency of
purchases, etc.

- **Customer Segmentation:** Utilize clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to segment
customers based on behavior and purchase patterns.

- **Visualization:** Create visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) to illustrate customer
segments.

- **Insights and Recommendations:** Analyze characteristics of each segment and provide
insights.

## Learning Objectives:

- Practical experience with clustering algorithms.
- Data cleaning and exploration skills.
- Visualization techniques for conveying insights.

## **Project 2** : [Data cleaning and Visualization](https://github.com/Eucharia29/OIBSIP/tree/main/Project%202)

### **Project Description:**

Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete
data within a dataset. Messy data leads to unreliable outcomes. Cleaning data is an essential
part of data analysis, and demonstrating your data cleaning skills is key to landing a job. 

## Key Concepts and Challenges:

- **Data Integrity:** Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout the
cleaning process.

- **Missing Data Handling:** Dealing with missing values by either imputing them or making
informed decisions on how to handle gaps in the dataset.

- **Duplicate Removal:** Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain data
uniqueness.

- **Standardization:** Consistent formatting and units across the dataset for accurate analysis.
Outlier Detection: Identifying and addressing outliers that may skew analysis or model
performance.

## **Project 3** : [EDA on Retail Sales](https://github.com/Eucharia29/OIBSIP/tree/main/Project%203)

### **Project Description:**

In this project, I worked with a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal was
to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can
help the retail business make informed decisions.

## Key Concepts and Challenges:

- **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Load the retail sales dataset.

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).

- **Time Series Analysis:** Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques.

- **Customer and Product Analysis:** Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.

- **Visualization:** Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.

- **Recommendations:** Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA.


## Learning Objectives:
- Gain hands-on experience in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
- Develop skills in interpreting descriptive statistics and time series analysis.
- Learn to use data visualization for effective communication of insights.
